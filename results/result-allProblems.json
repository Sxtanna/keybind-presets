If this option is disabled, warnings like *exception is possible* will not be reported. The inspection will report only warnings like *exception will definitely occur*.

In this case, the inspection will suggest propagating the `@Nullable` annotation. You can also configure nullability annotations using the **Configure Annotations** button.\n* Use the **Treat non-annotated members and parameters as @Nullable** option to assume that non-annotated members can be null, so they must not be used in non-null context.\n* Use the **Report not-null required parameter with null-literal argument usages** option to report method parameters that cannot be null (e.g. immediately dereferenced in the method body), but there are call sites where a `null` literal is passed.\n* Use the **Report nullable methods that always return a non-null value** option to report methods that are annotated as `@Nullable`, but always return non-null value. In this case, it's suggested that you change the annotation to `@NotNull`.\n* Use the **Don't report assertions with condition statically proven to be always true** option to avoid reporting assertions that were statically proven to be always true. This also includes conditions like `if (alwaysFalseCondition) throw new IllegalArgumentException();`.\n* Use the **Ignore assert statements** option to control how the inspection treats `assert` statements. By default, the option is disabled, which means that the assertions are assumed to be executed (-ea mode). If the option is enabled, the assertions will be completely ignored (-da mode).\n* Use the **Warn when reading a value guaranteed to be constant** option to add warnings on reading variables that contain some constant values, for example: `true`, `false`, or `null`.\n* Use the **Report problems that happen only on some code paths** option to control whether to report problems that may happen only on some code path. If this option is disabled, warnings like *exception is possible* will not be reported. The inspection will report only warnings like *exception will definitely occur*. This mode may greatly reduce the number of false-positives, especially if the code is not consistently annotated with nullability and contract annotations.
